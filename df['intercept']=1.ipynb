In this context, the change in price, when area of a house changes by a single unit, will be represented by value **b1**. Our intercept **b0**, is the value of house when it has no area at all (other...TODO ). Now that we have our interpretations down, lets dive into some code."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It will proceed to find b1 and leave out b0 because there is no other predictor given to it for which it will calculate the weight. Without intercept, we are forcing the line to always pass by the origin (0, 0) and we will never get the predictive relationship we are seeking between price and area as per the fitted model. So, initializing the intercept should never be skipped, unless there is gaurantee that the linear approximation of the linear regression model either by some theoretical or any other reasons is forced to go through the origin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want the value of intercept as it is , we multiply it with 1, that is, **weight (= b0) * predictor( = 1)** which suffices our need. So, we give OLS, the equation:\n",
